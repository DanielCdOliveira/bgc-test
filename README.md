# A web scrapper API

## Important:

This application is a web scraper that saves the best selling products on the page https://www.amazon.com.br/bestsellers. For this, a cron was configured that triggers the web scrapper at 4:00 am UTC. For the first use it is necessary to change the cron time in the serverless.yaml file:

```
functions:
  cronScrapAmazon:
    handler: lambdas/schedulesTasks/cronScrapAmazon.handler
    events:
      - schedule: cron(MM HH * * ? *)
```

Just modify the hour (from 0 to 23) and minute(from 0 to 59) to a time close to deploy wait for the trigger and then if you prefer you can return it to the standard time
